Education
 University of Liverpool (2021-2024)
BSC Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence 
    • First Year Average: 81.5%
    • Second Year Average: 69.8%
    • Third Year Average so far: 76%
Group Project(COMP 208) provided valuable experience in collaborative coding and due to project being a modification to an existing software, enhanced skills in comprehending and manipulating unfamiliar code.
Robot Perception and Manipulation (COMP341) and Autonomous Mobile Robotics(COMP 329) both gave a valuable framework for the mathematical underlying for kinematics and pose estimation. 
COMP341 and Image processing (ELEC319) gave an understanding how to implement computer vision techniques into robotics and each gave multiple techniques to improve efficiency of robot manipulation and reinforcement learning.
COMP390 Dissertation: Robot Learning for Laboratory Environments
A year long project researching how robots learnt a simulated environment (Orbit with NVIDIA Isaac) with the goal of designing robotic chemists. In my project, I focused specifically on using deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning such that the robot learns how to lift a beaker. This was picked as is a simple and yet necessary task in Chemistry labs, and with the knowledge gained this skill can be expanded into a full chemistry workflow.
BRGS SIXTH FORM
A Levels in Biology (B), Chemistry (B), Physics(C), Computer Science (A)
Research Experience
AIChemy Summer Research Internship (2024)
	The goal of this internship is to develop a simulated environment in Orbit-Chemistry to study the sim2real gap between simulated materials in robotic environments to real materials in manipulation tasks. The material that is focused on in this internship is a slurry and how it reacts to being stirred. This internship is in collaboration with the University of Toronto and Acceleration Consortium.
Teaching experience
Postgraduate Demonstrator University of Liverpool (2022,2023)
Introduction to AI: Demonstrated exercises for the weekly assignments to 4 classes and did marking for the module. This improved my presenting skills and how to explain new concepts to individuals unfamiliar with them.
Committee Member of Game Development Society University of Liverpool
Ran multiple training sessions over the past two years teaching interested participants how to make a game, with a focus on enemy AI and how game engines work.
